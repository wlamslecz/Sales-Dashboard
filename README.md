This is a project in which I 
  Imported data from an external source 
  Removed all order number duplicates
  Inserted an extra column that combined customer's first and last names using CONCAT
  Created a duplicate table entirely by copying a single row and using VLOOKUP to create the rest
  Used PivotTables to sum up the most important information about the data
  Used a combinaion of Shapes, PivotCharts, and Slicers to create an interactive Sales Dashboard
  Edited the formatting to improve the appearance of the charts
